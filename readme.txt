A fork of stanoba/ospiLCD to add pressure monitoring.  This may be useful where the 
sprinkler system is supplied from a pump.

I just use the LCD code to tell when the system is on.

Ideas for future improvements:

Average the pressure readings.  I seem to get a number of emails of pressure drops and 
then recovery.  Ignoring brief pressure drops would eliminate these notifications.

Could send pressure at end of run.  This would indicate if system needs attention before next run.
